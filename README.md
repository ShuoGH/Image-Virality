# Modelling the Image Virality

To record the details of my summer project, to explore the relationship between the content of images and their virality.

This repo is built for the sync between the server and my own laptop.

Files:

- `Load_OriginalDataSet.ipynb`: Load the original data set from the previous paper
- `EDA_data_csv.ipynb`: load the csv file and do the EDA.
- `data_set.py`: define the data set of images
- `download_images.py`: downloads all the images (`mkdir images` before executing)
